    <h6 class="mt-4">Today, for good reason, most academic exercises are also industry facing. It is much the same at Bennett University. The career services cell here spares no effort in bringing industry opportunities to the students of all the six schools. These opportunities come by way of internships, workshops, placement camps and such other. The cell also enables students to attend summer schools in various partner universities abroad to help them gain international exposure. Besides, the cell also organises various innovative programs to encourage students to come up with novel ideas for entrepreneurship.</h6>
